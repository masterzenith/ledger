# Prerequisites (stuff you need to have installed to run this code)

To be able to run the code in the exercise, you will need to install some software onto your machine.  We've written the exercise code to have as few dependencies as possible to make the set up simple.

We recommend installing the required tools at least a day _before_ your scheduled interview, and setting aside at least an hour for it.

* A computer with a microphone and preferably a camera
* Java JDK (at least version 8)
  * Installation instructions for each operating system can be found at [Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
* A text editor or IDE
  * There are no restrictions on which text editor or IDE you use
  * If you don't already have one we recommend [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download), which is free.

To verify your installation, and familiarise yourself with IntelliJ, try out the code in [Jetbrains' Tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html) to build and run a "Hello World" example.
